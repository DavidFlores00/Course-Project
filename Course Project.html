        <h2> High-impact Tutoring</h2>
        <p> Parents living below the poverty line seeking to improve their children's academic prospects should consider
            SCAâ€™s high-impact tutoring program because its effectiveness in helping children develop skills reduces
            educational inequalities in Southeast Los Angeles's underserved communities.

            <h3> The Resources of Southeast Community Academy
            </h3>
            <p>There are many challenges the people SCA seek to help have. Some of them consist of low income, lack of
                one or both parents, transportation issues, and low education attainment. Children with sufficient
                resources have always had access to excellent tutoring. However, pupils of color and those with low
                incomes have not always had access to the kind of focused tutoring that is effective. High-Impact
                Tutoring programs help raise low-income students' academic performance by providing tutoring to more
                children who need it and have less resources. Additionally, High-Impact Tutoring has a history of
                reducing the achievement inequalities among ethnic groups.

            <h4> Solution</h4>
            <p> The high-impact tutoring system would address the life challenges mentioned above by students receiving
                specialized attention that is not available to them in a busy classroom. This benefits under-challenged
                kids as well as kids who have trouble keeping up. Additionally, it helps pupils stay on course when they
                have time off from school, like March Break or the summer.
